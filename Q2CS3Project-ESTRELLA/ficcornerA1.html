  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <p id="ficcorner">"The Blood of Olympus" is the final book of the "Heroes of Olympus" series, written by Rick Riordan. The story revolves around the Greek and Roman crewmembers of the Argo II, who have been on multiple quests to defeat Gaea, the earth's mother. Despite their progress, they seem distant from achieving their goal. Gaea's giants have risen and are mightier than ever, and they need to cease before the Feast of Spes, where Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. Their blood is crucial as it will allow Gaea to wake up and wreak havoc on the world.</p>
  <p id="ficcorner">The demigods experience more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood, and the Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. While they contemplate taking the Athena Parthenos to Athens as a secret weapon, the friends realize that it belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the Greek and Roman camps. As a result, the Athena Parthenos will go west, and the Argo II will go east. The gods, suffering from multiple personality disorders, are of no use (The Blood of Olympus, n.d.).</p>
  <p id="ficcorner">The demigods have no other option but to fight against Gaea's army of powerful giants. They know the danger of heading to Athens. However, they thought they had already sacrificed too much to give up now. If Gaea wakes up, it will be game over.</p>

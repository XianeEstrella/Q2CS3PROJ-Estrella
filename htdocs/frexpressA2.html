    <p>Author: XC</p>

    <p>Are you ready for an underwater adventure that will leave you spellbound? Look no further than the Philippines! With over 7,100 islands nestled in the Coral Triangle's nutrient-rich waters, the marine life here is like a fairy tale coming to life. From steep drop-offs and tropical caves to World War II wrecks, the marine landscape is a canvas of hard and soft corals that weave a spellbinding world for thousands of wacky fish species. And that's just the beginning!</p>
    <p>Hover the image to see the underwater creatures!</p>

    <div class="circle"><img src="Dugong.jpg" alt="Dugong" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Imagine diving in the waters of Coron in Northern Palawan, where you might catch a glimpse of dugongs, also known as sea cows. These are endangered gentle giants worldwide, but protected marine zones have been established over seagrass meadows in the Philippines to help restore their population. 
    </p>

    <h1>Theresher Sharks</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Thresher Shark.jpg" alt="Thresher Sharks" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Or how about encountering Thresher Sharks off Malapascua? These magnificent creatures can reach up to 6 meters or 20 feet long and have strange-looking extended tails, which they use to herd fish. You're virtually guaranteed to see them when diving in this area! 
    </p>

    <h1>Sea Turles</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Green Turtle.jpg" alt="Sea Turtles" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Sea turtles are also a common sight in the waters of the Philippines, and the country is lucky to be home to six of seven endangered Sea Turtle species. As you explore the reefs, keep an eye out for these gentle creatures napping under ledges.</p>
    
    <h1>Pygmy Seahorses</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Pygmy Seahorse.jpg" alt="Pygmy Seahorses" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Pygmy Seahorses are very difficult to spot due to their size and camouflaging ability; they particularly like to live within gorgonian corals.</p>

    <h1>Napolean Wrasse</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Napolean Wrasse.jpg" alt="Napolean Wrasse" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Napoleon Wrasse, the Humphead Wrasse, or Maori Wrasse, are large fish that can grow up to 2 meters and 180 kilograms or 400 pounds! They are a beautiful blue-green color with an unusual hump on their head. This endangered species is widely distributed throughout the Philippines, so be on the lookout.</p>

    <h1>Harleyquin Shrimp</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Harlequin Shrimp.jpg" alt="Harleyquin Shrimp" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Harlequin Shrimp are great models for underwater photographers due to their tiny size and vivid colors. Only reaching 5 centimeters or 2 inches in size, they are white with large blue, purple, or pink spots. Macro photographers can find Harlequin Shrimp and other species like the rare Coleman’s Shrimp and Boxer Shrimp when muck diving in places such as Dumaguete.</p>

    <h1>Frogfish</h1>
    <div class="circle"><img src="Clown Frogfish Nursery - Dauin, Philippines - Dive Happy.jpg" alt="Frogfish" width="250" height="250"></div>
    <p>Frogfish are interesting, decorative fish with grumpy-looking faces. They can be found in vast colors and boast frilly bait-like appendages, which they use to lure prey. They are a must-see for keen underwater photographers!</p>

    <h1>In Conclusion,</h1>
    <p>Whether you explore the remote reef system on a liveaboard or relax on the famous beaches of Cebu, Bohol, and Palawan, the Philippines is a paradise for divers and non-divers alike. With beautiful scenery above and below the surface, this must-dive destination ensures taking your breath away!</p>
